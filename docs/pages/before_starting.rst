Before starting
===============

The LBAF is available from source only now. It requires `Python 3.8 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ to run.
Currently, the only working version of Python is 3.8. This is due to the compatibility of used packages.
Please mind your platform as well as proper 32 or 64 bit version.

Make sure you have all required Pyhon packages installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Make sure you are in project directory
  pip install -r requirements.txt

Requirements are divided into `LBAF dependencies`, `LBAF testing` and `LBAF building package`:

* `LBAF dependencies` are needed in order to LBAF to work.

* `LBAF testing` are needed for testing purposes.

* `LBAF documentation` are needed for building documentation.

* `LBAF building package` are needed in order to build a package
