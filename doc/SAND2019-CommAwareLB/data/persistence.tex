One key assumption to statistically-based fully-distributed
load-balancing, using Grapevine-like algorithms, is that of
\emph{persistence} of object loads as the computation progresses.

Albeit relatively intuitive, this notion does not appear to have
received, to-date, a general treatment in the open literature.
We are therefore now proposing a general methodology for the
quantitative assessment of this concept, in particular in (but not
limited to) the context of per-object loads.
