In contrast, as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{Grapevine-n8-lstats-i5-k4-f4-t1_0.0-vom}, the original
algorithm becomes quickly trapped in a local, very sub-optimal minimum.
Indeed, once the most heavily loaded processor ($0$) has shipped all
possible objects to the least loaded once without making them
overloaded, the $3$ processors whose initial load is closest to the
mean $\overline{\mathcal{L}}\approx0.52595$, albeit slightly
underloaded, are forced by the same criterion $\texttt{6}$
to rejected all proposed object transfers that can make them
overloaded, even slightly.
This results in a locked configuration where no global improvement can
further occur, although the global imbalance~$\mathcal{I}$ remains
high.

As a result of all preceding results, both theoretical and
experimental, we propose to use exclusively our variant of the
algorithm in the future \textsf{VT} load-balancer implementation.
