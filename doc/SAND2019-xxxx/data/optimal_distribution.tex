By \emph{optimal distribution}, what is meant in what follows is the
best possible processor/load distribution that may be achieved given
the sets of processors~$\mathbf{P}$ and of objects~$\mathbf{O}$.

It is obvious that if all objects have identical times, and
$\vert\mathbf{P}\vert$ divides $\vert\mathbf{O}\vert$, then any
equi-distribution is optimal and is obtained by assigning exactly
$\tfrac{\vert\mathbf{O}\vert}{\vert\mathbf{P}\vert}$ object(s) to each
processor in $\mathbf{P}$.
However, it is safe to assume that this ideal case will very seldom,
if ever, be encountered in any real case.
