By \emph{optimal distribution}, what is meant in what follows is
the best possible load/processor distribution that may be achieved given
the sets of processors~$\mathbf{P}$ and of objects~$\mathbf{O}$.
It is not necessarily unique; in fact, except in the uni-processor
case, it is not, because if one load distribution across
$\vert{\mathbf{P}}\vert>1$ processors is optimal, then any
distribution obtained by exchanging all objects between two processors
is also optimal.
