In this section, we use the VOM viewer that we created to generate
to create graphs representing the object move counts prescribed by
the load-balancer.
In these graphs, vertices represent the processors, while edges
represent object moves, and are endowed with two attributes: directed
and undirected moves, i.e., respectively, the number of object
transfers in each direction, and the total count of movements in both
directions.
While the edge coloring scheme indicates the latter, overlaid arrows
using the same color scale indicate the prescribed traffic in each
direction.
In particular, two-way traffic is indicated by pairs of opposing
arrows, whereas in the case where object moves are prescribed in a
single direction between two processors, a single overlaid arrow will
indicate that -- it will also, as a result, have the same color as the
edge over which it is drawn.
