Graph representing the number of inter-rank object moves prescribed by the load-balancer
after  $5$ iterations of our improved version (with criterion \texttt{6'}) when $k=f=4$.
Two-way traffic is indicated by pairs of opposing arrows; edges are undirected so that
their respective colors represented absolute traffic over both directions.
