We now present, in Figures~\ref{f1} and~\ref{f2}, the comparative behaviors in
both terms of load imbalance and maximum load, in the case of $o=10^4$
objects initially distributed across $p=2^4$ amongst $n=2^{12}$
processors, of the \textsf{NodeGossiper} simulator with an overload
threshold of $t=1.0$ and a fanout factor of $f=6$.

We note that the object times were pseudo-randomly generated with uniform
sampling in $[10^{-5};10^{-1}]$, and that the $o$ objects were also
uniformly pseudo-randomly assigned to a subset of $p$ processors.
