We now empirically examine the comparative effect in terms of load
imbalance as well as of maximum load, of simultaneously increasing and
decreasing the number of iterations and rounds, so that $i\times{k}$
remains constant.

This is illustrated here in the case of $o=10^4$ objects initially
distributed across $p=2^4$ amongst $n=2^{12}$ processors, of the
\textsf{NodeGossiper} simulator with an overload threshold of $t=1.0$
and a fanout factor of $f=6$.
The object times were also pseudo-randomly generated with uniform
sampling in $[10^{-5};10^{-1}]$, and that the $o$ objects were also
uniformly pseudo-randomly assigned to a subset of $p$ processors.

Because the time-to-solutions were approximately equal ($\approx52$s)
as a result of $i\times{k}$ being equal to $20$ in both cases,
the $x$-axis of
Figure~\ref{NodeGossiper-n4096-p16-o10000-uniform-f6-t1_0--0s-52s}
was re-normalized with respect to a common actual runtime of $52$s,
and the state at the end of each balancing iteration is shown. We note
that in reality the time-to-solution in the $i=10$ case was slightly
higher than with $i=2$, as a result of the latter requiring $11$~I/O
calls, in contrast with the $3$ calls required by the former.
We observe that not only time-to-solutions are identical, but that
allowing for more iterations is better, \emph{ceteris paribus}, than
allowing for more gossiping rounds.
