The case used here is that of a run performed on 8 processors using
the \textsf{Virtual Transport} (\textsf{VT}) asynchronous many 
mapping was output every several time steps, using a data exchange
format (\texttt{.vom}) that we created for that purpose.
The \textsf{NodeGossiper} is endowed with both a reader and writer for
this format, allowing it to compute a hopefully better-balanced object
mapping than the one it was handed by the simulation code.

\caption{\label{t:vt-example} Object mapping statistics of the initial
object/processor load distribution of a \textsf{VT}-based simulation
on~8 ranks.}
\end{table}

The experiment we are presenting used an object mapping of which some
key statistical properties are shown in Table~\ref{t:vt-example}: the
first row provides the values for the object times themselves, read
from the \texttt{.vom} files, while the second line presents those for
our variable of interest, the per-processor load~$\mathcal{L}$.
We note in particular that this case was especially poorly balanced to
boot, with the most heavily loaded rank being assigned $500$ times
more work that the least loaded one, and an overall load imbalance
almost half the size of the rank set.
