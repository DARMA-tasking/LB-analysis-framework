The case used here is that of a run performed on 8 processors using
the \textsf{Virtual Transport} (\textsf{VT}) asynchronous many
mapping was output every several time steps, using a data exchange
format (\texttt{.vom}) that we created for that purpose.
The \textsf{NodeGossiper} is endowed with both a reader and writer for
this format, allowing it to compute a hopefully better-balanced object
mapping than the one it was handed by the simulation code.
