The goal of this chapter is to exhibit the statistical properties of
some cases for which those can be explicitly calculated, hereby
providing the basis for reference non-regression testing as well as
performance comparisons.

In particular, all observed processor/load distributions will be
compared to the ideal \emph{equi-distribution}, in which all
objects are assigned in such a way that all processors in the
collection~$\mathbf{P}$ have identical load.
We note that this does not require that all objects have the same
load.

Respectively denoting $\vert{L}\vert$ and $\delta_i$ the total load
across~$\mathbf{P}$, and the Dirac delta function on processor
$p_i\in\mathbf{P}$, we can denote
$\mathcal{L}=\frac{\vert{L}\vert}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\delta_i$ the
equi-distribution on~$\mathbf{P}$, for which we have 
the following statistics:
$\min{\mathcal{L}} = \max{\mathcal{L}}
= \overline{\mathcal{L}} = \frac{\vert{L}\vert{}}{N}$,
$\sigma_{\mathcal{L}}^2 = \mu_{3,\mathcal{L}} = \mu_{4,\mathcal{L}} = 0$,
and
$\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{L}}= 0$
for obvious reasons.

All observed processor/load distributions will have to be compared
against this ideal baseline.
