Here we discuss the original \emph{informed transfer} algorithm of the
\textsf{Grapevine} algorithm. We begin with line 6 of said algorithm:
\[
\mathtt{6:} \qquad \mathrm{\mathbf{if}} \; (L_X + load(O_i) < L_{avg})
\; \mathrm{\mathbf{then}}
\]

This is motivated by our observations with our first experiments with
a strict \textsf{Grapevine} implementation of a high rejection rate of
this condition. Furthermore, this rejection rate only slowly and
marginally decreased with the increase in the number of
\emph{gossiping rounds} ($k$) in the first phase (gossip algorithm) of
\textsf{Grapevine}.
