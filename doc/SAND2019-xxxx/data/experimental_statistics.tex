The experiment we are presenting used an object mapping read from the
\texttt{.vom} files, whose aggregrated per-processor times are
illustrated in Figure~\ref{vt-example_rank_loads}: a cursory visual inspection
of this histogram readily indicates a poorly-balanced initial distribution.

object/processor load distribution of a \textsf{VT}-based simulation
on~8 ranks.}
\end{table}

In order to provide a quantitative assessment of the distributions
obtained after having applied the \textsf{NodeGossiper} (with either
of its two of variants), with respect to the initial situation, some
key statistical properties are shown in Table~\ref{t:vt-example}: the
first row provides the values for the object times themselves, while
the second line presents those for our variable of interest, the
per-processor load~$\mathcal{L}$.
These statistics indicate in particular overall load imbalance
that is almost half the size of the rank set, with the most heavily
loaded rank being assigned $500$ times more work that the least loaded
one.
We shall now examine how both versions of the algorithm perform in
this case.
