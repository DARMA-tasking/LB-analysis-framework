In this chapter, we compare the results of the original Grapevine load-balancing algorithm,
with those obtained with our modified version therefore, when applied to a real
case whose input data, rather than being pseudo-randomly generated as in the previously
discussed cases, was provided by an object mapping output by a VT-based simulation.

We also illustrate the somewhat non-intuitive object transfers that were performed by our
algorithm in order to attain a near-optimal solution.
