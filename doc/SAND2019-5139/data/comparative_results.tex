We now compare the results obtained with the two different
implementations (with original criterion and
\texttt{6} vs. with modified criterion \texttt{6'}) by
using in both cases the following input parameters: $i=5$, $k=f=4$,
and an overload threshold $T=1_0$, and identical seedings of the
pseudo-random number generator used by the samplers in the two phases
of the algorithm.

\caption{\label{t:comparative_results} Object mapping statistics
obtained after $5$ iterations of the load-balancing algorithm with
both version of the decision criteria (\texttt{6} vs. \texttt{6'})
when $k=f=4$.}
\end{table}

The results obtained for each experiment  presented in
Table~\ref{t:comparative_results}. Cardinalities and averages are
omitted as they are identical to those indicated in the last row of
Table~\ref{t:vt-example}, as both are invariant because we do not
allow the number of ranks (nor of course the total load) to change
during the load-balancing process.

In particular, we observe that the original version of the algorithm
only marginally improved the results, with a global imbalance
$\mathcal{I}$ keeping the same order of magnitude pre- and
post-load-balancing; in contrast, when using our variant \texttt{6'}, the
same was improved more than thirty-fold.
Furthermore, we can see that the range $R$ in the latter case has a
value ($0.077759$) that is almost equal to that of the standard
deviation of object times ($0.074587$): in other words, our modified
criterion allows the load-balancing to reach near-optimality in this
case as well, with modest values of $i$, $k$, and $f$.
This quantitative comparison confirms what we had demonstrated before,
from first principles and analytical cases.
